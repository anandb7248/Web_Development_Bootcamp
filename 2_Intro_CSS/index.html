        <h1>Anand Batjargal</h1>
        <p><em>Computer Science B.S. 2018</em> <a href="https://www.calpoly.edu/" <strong>California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo</strong></a></p>
        <p>I am a senior at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) studying Computer Science with an expected graduation in December 2018.
          During my studies at Cal Poly, which began in September 2016, I interned as a Software Engineering Intern at Intuit, a teaching assistant for CSC 436: Mobile App Development, as well as a ITS assistant at Cal Poly Service Desk.
          I have been a teaching assistant for iOS mobile development from September 2017 - June 2018, helping students in lab with their assigned coursework, using Xcode, and programming in Swift. As of September 2018 - December 2018, I will be
          helping
          students on Android mobile development, using Android Studio and programming in Kotlin.
          In the summer of 2018, I was a Software Engineering Intern at Intuit in their San Diego campus. Working on Turbo in the iOS software team. At Intuit I obtained valuable work experience, I got to experience the software engineering
          methodologies
          of scum/agile, finding and fixing bugs, using git and GitHub, understanding the existing codebase, and to working on new features that product managers wanted to implement on the application.
          I truly enjoy software development and wish to learn more as I progress. I currently have mobile app experience, but I wish to make side projects to learn more about web development, backend, and machine learning.
          Feel free to reach out to me over LinkedIn for any questions.</p>
